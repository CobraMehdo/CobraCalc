        <h2>Preparation Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            In preparation for this exam, I started by reviewing the topics outlined in the class syllabus and lecture notes, 
            focusing especially on derivatives, limits, and exponential functions. I studied for about an hour a day during the week 
            leading up to the test. For the topics I found difficult—like applying the chain rule and solving word problems involving 
            rates of change—I watched videos online, went to office hours, and practiced problems from previous quizzes and homework. 
            I made flashcards for key formulas and worked through problems with a study group twice that week. My approach was active: 
            I solved problems on paper rather than just reading solutions, and I tested myself regularly to see which topics still needed work.

        <h2>Post-Exam Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            After I received my exam grade, I looked over every problem I got wrong and tried to understand my mistakes. Most of them 
            came from small calculation errors and misreading problem instructions. I went over the test with a tutor and reworked the 
            incorrect problems with step-by-step explanations. I realized that I had rushed through the last few problems, so I’m now 
            practicing pacing myself better on timed exams. To avoid repeating the same errors, I’ve also started reviewing my work 
            more thoroughly before submitting it and doing a quick mental check of my answers whenever possible.
